## Application
### Database Creation
#### a) Create CSVs temporary files

**CreaCSVs.ipyb** creates 7 temporary files from the files obtained in the data cleaning process
- PatentDrug.csv, Request.csv, RequestMedCode.csv, PurchaseOrder.csv, POReqMedCode.csv, PatientCosumption.csv, PatConsMedCode.csv

#### b) Create Database

**CreateDB.ipyb** creates the tables in the PostgreSQL Database from the temporary files, according with the Database design included in the next image:

### Web Site
#### a) Web Application Framework Django:
The directory Django contains the files to enable the environment, the Web Site permits manage the information and produce reports.

#### b) Dash Framework:
It's integrated to Django to create the Dashboards with themes called layouts. The graphs are integrated with Plotly python structure code, wich is included in the directory Django/Dalinde/Dalinde/dash_apps.

### Run Server

**Requirements**
- Install python
- Add packages: dash 1.10.0, django 3.0.3, django-plotly-dash 1.3.1, gekko 0.2.6, matplotlib 3.1.3, numpy                1.18.4, pandas 1.0.3, plotly 4.7.1, psycopg 2 2.8.4, sqlalchemy 1.3.16

In Django/Dalinde directory run:
- python manage.py makemigrations
- python manage.py migrate
- python manage.py runserver

## Data Analysis

### Data cleaning

Data cleaning is documented in the file [data_cleaner.ipynb](data-analysis/data_cleaner.ipynb). This notebook takes a series of Excel files from [data-analysis/data/](data-analysis/data/) and [data-analysis/data_2020](data-analysis/data2020/) and outputs a group of CSV files needed for the Exploratory Data Analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis is documented in the notebook [EDA.ipynb](data-analysis/EDA.ipynb). This notebook takes the CSV files generated by the data cleaner and explains the process of the data exploration and discusses relevant findings.

## Modeling

### ARIMA model

The notebook [ARIMA_model.ipynb](modeling/ARIMA_model.ipynb) uses the TOP 9 MedCodes produced in the [EDA.ipynb](data-analysis/EDA.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.

The code provided here computes the 9 ARIMA models for each of the time series, and outputs CSV files with the results. 

### RNN model

The code for the implementation of the Recurrent Neural Network model for forecasting time series is documented in the file [RNN_model.ipynb](modeling/RNN_model.ipynb).

## Model comparison

A comparison between the modeling approaches was made. This is documented in the file [model_comparison.ipynb](modeling/model_comparison.ipynb).

## PID controller

The Jupyter notebook [PID_controller.ipynb](modeling/PID_controller.ipynb)

In this document you will find the complete description of the PID system, with which the inventory optimization is made.

The first section corresponds to the analysis of the csv files to obtain the top 9 of the most consumed drugs. This section was prepared as discussed in the [Exploratory Data Analysis](### Exploratory Data Analysis) subsection, more detail of it can be found in the predictive modeling section with ARIMA and Neural Network

The section titled: PID INVENTORY LEVEL CONTROL, contains all the information relevant to the PID process for inventory modeling.

To have the complete charts of the 9 most consumed drugs, 9 csv files are used, which are titled as follows:

* top 9 combivent.csv
* top 9 combivent_respimat.csv
* top 9 firac plus.csv
* top 9 flixotide 2mg.csv
* top 9 indaflex.csv
* top 9 lipitor.csv
* top 9 mydocalm_C.csv
* top 9 somazina.csv
* top 9 vancocin_CP.csv

For the simulation, GEKKO is used, which is a package of analysis, simulation and resolution of differential equations, integral among others.

To install it inside the jupyter use:
```
!pip install gekko --upgrade
```
